# PProvost.DevTools

This Chocolatey package aggregates (via dependency on other chocolatey packages) a
set of tools that I like to install on a new development environment. This does not
include desktop utilities, which are included in [PProvost.DesktopUtils][1]

**Packages Included**
* curl
* fiddler
* git.install
* ilspy
* kickassvim
* p4merge

For information about included packages, visit http://chocolatey.org/.
