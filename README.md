A collection of my Chocolatey packages. For the most part these are aggregations
of other packages to make it quick and easy for me to setup a new machine, but
may also contain other packages I create.

## Current Packages

* PProvost.DesktopUtils - aggregates stuff I like to have on a desktop (not dev) machine,
   e.g. 7zip, AHK, greenshot, sysinternals
* PProvost.DevTools - aggregates stuff I like to have on all my dev machines, e.g.
   e.g. curl, git, ilspy, vim, p4merge
